Us; Clutching our stomachs, 
doubling over in laughter

a year passes with us barely noticing 

understanding faces,
each of us venting our worries

a year passes with us barely noticing 

sleepovers, sing-alongs, and skateboarding become habitual

a year will soon pass with us barely noticing

and what will happen to us then?
New school, new people, new friends?

I'll just have to wait till next year to find out
